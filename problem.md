**Project Title**: Geometry Module

**Objective:** Develop a Python module named `geometry` that provides services to compute and handle geometric figures: circles, squares, and rectangles. The module should include initializers,
string representations, and comparison capabilities for each figure type. Additionally, create a test script to verify the functionality of these components. The project should be
hosted on GitHub and executable from the command line, with clear documentation and example snippets provided for users.

**Details:**

1.**Module Structure:**

* `geometry`
  * `Circle`: A class to represent a circle with methods to initialize, compute area, circumference, and provide string representations. Implement comparison methods to compare circles by area.

  * `Square`: A class to represent a square with methods to initialize, compute area, perimeter, and provide string representations. Implement comparison methods to compare squares by area.

  * `Rectangle`: A class to represent a rectangle with methods to initialize, compute area, perimeter, and provide string representations. Implement comparison methods to compare rectangles by area.

2.**Features for Each Class:**

* **Initializer** **(`__init__`)**: Accept dimensions (e.g., radius for circle, side length for square, width and height for rectangle) as parameters.

* **String Representation** **(`__str__`)**: Return a string detailing the dimensions and area of the figure.

* **Comparison Methods** **(`__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc.)**: Allow for comparison of objects based on their area, enabling sorting and equality checks.

3.**Test Script**:

* Develop a script named `test_geometry.py`that uses Pythonâ€™s `unittest` framework.
* Include tests for each type of geometric figure covering initializations, area calculations, perimeter calculations, string outputs, and object comparisons.

4.**Documentation:**

* Provide a `README.md`file with:
  * Instructions on how to install any dependencies.
  * Examples on how to use the geometry module.
  * Command line instructions for running the tests.

5.**Execution:**

* The module should be executable from the command line. Include a `main.py` that demonstrates the creation and manipulation of different geometric figures.
* Add command-line argument parsing in `main.py`to allow users to specify which figure to work with and its dimensions.

6.**GitHub Deployment:**

* Initialize a GitHub repository with appropriate .gitignore settings for Python projects.
* Ensure the repository contains the module files, test script, `main.py`, and `README.md`.
* Include a license file to specify the terms under which the software can be used.

7.**Example Snippets:**

* Include sample snippets in both the `README.md` and as docstrings in the module itself, demonstrating how to create objects of each class and how to use their methods.

  **End Goal:** This project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly Python package for handling basic geometric calculations, which can be used in educational contexts or as a utility in larger projects. The thorough testing and documentation will ensure the module's reliability and ease of use.
